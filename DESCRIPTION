Description: Extendable set of tools to facilitate training, tuning and testing 
    of tree-based models.
    Designed to quickly produce a good baseline model, that can be further tuned manually.
    The primary value generated by the forester package is to promptly build a baseline for other, 
    more complex models. 
    This package extends the prototype developed by the https://github.com/ModelOriented/forester project.
    Results are explainers consistent with DrWhy universe.
    Explanations from the DALEX library can be used without any further preparation.
    As tree models are trained, the explanations developed by the TreeShap method can be used. 
    So resulting explanations have a quick feedback loop that can leverage Navigated Data Exploration.
